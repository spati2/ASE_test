ii1. **Ripping**
A dynamic process in which the Graphic-User-Interface(of software or app) is automatically traversed by opening all the windows(or screens) and then extract all the widgets' properties and values. This extracted information is verified and used by the test designer to generate multiple test cases. GUI ripping helps to understand both structural and execution behaviour of the GUI. 

ii2. **GUI Tree**
An intuitive represenation of the structure extracted during ripping. The nodes of the tree represent the individual User-Interfaces(screens) in the App, while the edges between them show the transition as a hierarchial relationship. Each node encapsulates the state of User-Interface,its objects and its properties.


GUI stands for Graphic-User-Interface.
