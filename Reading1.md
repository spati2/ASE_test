ii1. **Ripping**
Ripping is the dynamic process in which the Graphic-User-Interface(of software or app) is automatically traversed by opening all the windows(or screens) and then extract all the widgets' properties and values. This extracted information is verified and used by the test designer to generate multiple test cases. GUI ripping helps to understand both structural and execution behaviour of the GUI.
