**ii.** **Keywords:**

ii1. **Ripping**:
A dynamic process in which the Graphic-User-Interface(of software or app) is automatically traversed by opening all the windows(or screens) and then extract all the widgets' properties and values. This extracted information is verified and used by the test designer to generate multiple test cases. GUI ripping helps to understand both structural and execution behaviour of the GUI. 

ii2. **GUI Tree**:
An intuitive represenation of the structure extracted during ripping. The nodes of the tree represent the individual User-Interfaces(screens) in the App, while the edges between them show the transition as a hierarchial relationship. Each node encapsulates the state of User-Interface,its objects and its properties.

ii3. **Bugs**:
Errors which produce undersirable outcome during app usage, also responsible for app malfunction. Popularly, andriod bugs are *Activity*-based which arise due to incorrect implementation of activity protocol, *Event*-based which arise when the app performs a wrong action for an incoming event, and *Dynamic*-based which come up due to runtime exceptions.
