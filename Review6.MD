+ In a few lines, differentiate regression and classification.
+ What is risk exposure? Give a mathematical expression to calculate it.
+ Sort the steps taken in predicting delays, as proposed by Dr. Hoa:
  * Extract Features, and select the ones that contribute to risk of delay.

  * Train classifiers.
+ In the following figure label **A** and **B**:
