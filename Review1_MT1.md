# Review1: Week of Aug 25

## Theory

Can you define the following?

1. Evolutionary algorithms
   1. Genetic algorithms
   	1. In the field of artificial intelligence, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection. This heuristic (also sometimes called a metaheuristic) is routinely used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems
   1. Genetic programsming
   	1. In artificial intelligence, genetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary algorithm-based methodology inspired by biological evolution to find computer programs that perform a user-defined task. Essentially GP is a set of instructions and a fitness function to measure how well a computer has performed a task.
1. Evolutionary programs 101
   1. Mutation
      1. Can u give examples of GA mutation? of GP mutation?
  1. Crossover
	  1. Can u give examples of GA crossover? of GP crossover
  1. Selection
    1. Binary domination
    1. Pareto frontier (hint a diagram is good here)
      1. spread
      1. hypervolume

____

1. Optimizing optimizers <img align=right width=400 src="http://snag.gy/Cdatd.jpg">
   (not examinable)	  
   1. Writing models: understanding and representing a domain. Very slow
   1. Enabling models: getting them running. Not fast
   1. Running them
      1. _M:_ Mutation cost: making  _M_ mutants
      2. _E_: Evaluating _M_ mutants
	     1. If any random variables in the model, then _E*20_ to _E*100*_
	  3. _S_: Selecting cost: worst case _S=M<sup>2</sup>_ comparisons
	  4. _G_: Generations: _G_ times: mutate, select, crossover, repeat
   1. Verification cost:
      1. 20 (say) repeated runs, for many models,  for many optimizers
   1. Techniques (using data mining!)
      1. _M_ cost is low. just do it,
         1. Then feed into some incremental clustering algorithm ([mini-batch k-means](http://goo.gl/V8BQs),
	        [Genic](http://papers.rgrossman.com/proc-079.pdf): [code](https://github.com/ai-se/timm/blob/ffc7071f133521014e69fc91c99aa9432510ffdb/genic.py#L5))
		 1. <img align=right src="http://snag.gy/41kWD.jpg" width=400>	Then only keep (say) a few examples per cluster, selected randomly,
		    
	   1. _E_ reductions:
	     1. In each cluster, find a handful of most different examples and just evaluate those  	 
	   1. _S_ reduction:
	     1. YOur _M_ reductions have also reduced your 	  _S=M<sup>2</sup>_ effort
	   1. _G_ remains. consider "near enough is good enough"<br clear=all>

____

1. Simulated annealing
   1. When to use SA
   1. Why random jumps?
   2. What is the cooling schedule?
      1. Why slow cooling? (when you jump less and less)
   1. When to stop
   1. Aggregation functions
      1. brittle aggregation functions

## Practice

For each of the following, can you offer a 3 line code snippet to demo
the idea?

1. Classes
1. Functions
1. Decorators
1. Static variables, functions
1. Scope
  1. nested scope
1. functions
  1. default params
  1. variable lists args
  1. variable dictionary args
  1. lambda bodies
1. list comprehensions
1. decorators
